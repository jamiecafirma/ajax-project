# ticket-stubs

A web application for movie lovers who want to keep track of the films they watch.

I watch a lot of movies, and it can be hard to keep track of what I watched, what were my initial thoughts of a film, when I watched it, and other miscellaneous details about each movie-watching experience. I built this project as a way to record these details and to be able to revisit them in the future.
